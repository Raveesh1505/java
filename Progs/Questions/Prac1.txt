Practical 1

Ques 1: Why is java considered dynamic?
Ans 1: Java is considered dynamic because of Bytecode. The source code which is written on one platform, is converted into classfile and then it can be run anywhere. The classfile is loaded suring the runtime only and hence it is called dynamically typed language.

Ques 2: What is Java Virtual Machine and how it is considered in context of Java's platform independent feature?
And 2: Java virtual machine is a package that provides specification to run the java bytecode on any platform. Java Virtual Machine can be downloaded on any platform and can run any java bytecode file.

Ques 3: List two Java IDEs. List some keywords.
And 3: Java IDE : IntelliJ IDEA and BlueJ. Keywords : println, System, class, public, private.

Ques 4: Consider the following class: 
    public class IdentifyMyParts { 
    public static int x = 7;  
    public int y = 3;  
} 
Ans 4: a) x = 7. b) y = 3


if else
switch
do while, start
for ( ; ; )
while (true)
In case a condition is not met and we have to bring the programme back to the start of the loop, then we use continue statment.
1 bit
for loop

Ans 1: 
a) Second string
Third string

b) Second string is printed because it falls under the first if condition of aNumber being greater than 0 and also under the else control statement of aNumber not being 0. Now third string is printed because it does not fall under any control statement.

c) if (aNumber > 0){
    if (aNumber == 0){
        System.out.println("First String");
    }
    else{
        System.out.println("Second String");
    }
}
System.out.println("Third string");

Ans 2: Semi-colon should be used instead of comma. Correct : (int k=2; k <= 12; k++)

Ans 3: A block of for loop consists of 3 statements. The first statement initialises the variable which is being used in the loop. The second statement defines the end point of the loop. The third statement of the block defines increament ot decreament of the reference variable.

Ans 4: num = 6


-===--===--===--===--===--===

Ans 1: No, we cannot pass negative number as an array size.
Ans 2: No, we cannot change the size of an array after declaration.
Ans 3: An array without any name is called an anonymous array. It may be created and used at any particular instance.
Ans 4: There is no difference. Both of them are used to declare integer type array.
Ans 5: A 2 dimentional array with unequal row size (sifferent number of elements in every row) is called a jagged array. Example: An array with 2 elements in first row but 3 in it's second row.

Flipped

Ans 1: d) int arr[] = int [5] new
Ans 2:
